    Supports multi-query and grouped-query attention (MQA/GQA) by passing in K, V with fewer heads
    than Q. Note that the number of heads in Q must be divisible by the number of heads in KV.
    For example, if Q has 6 heads and K, V have 2 heads, head 0, 1, 2 of Q will attention to head
    0 of K, V, and head 3, 4, 5 of Q will attention to head 1 of K, V.

    If causal=True, the causal mask is aligned to the bottom right corner of the attention matrix.
    For example, if seqlen_q = 2 and seqlen_k = 5, the causal mask (1 = keep, 0 = masked out) is:
        1 1 1 1 0
        1 1 1 1 1
    If seqlen_q = 5 and seqlen_k = 2, the causal mask is:
        0 0
        0 0
        0 0
        1 0
        1 1
    If the row of the mask is all zero, the output will be zero.

    If window_size != (-1, -1), implements sliding window local attention. Query at position i
    will only attend to keys between
    [i + seqlen_k - seqlen_q - window_size[0], i + seqlen_k - seqlen_q + window_size[1]] inclusive.

    Arguments:
        q: (total_q, nheads, headdim), where total_q = total number of query tokens in the batch.
        k: (total_k, nheads_k, headdim), where total_k = total number of key tokens in the batch.
        v: (total_k, nheads_k, headdim), where total_k = total number of key tokens in the batch.
        cu_seqlens_q: (batch_size + 1,), dtype torch.int32. The cumulative sequence lengths
           of the sequences in the batch, used to index into q.
        cu_seqlens_k: (batch_size + 1,), dtype torch.int32. The cumulative sequence lengths
           of the sequences in the batch, used to index into kv.
        max_seqlen_q: int. Maximum query sequence length in the batch.
        max_seqlen_k: int. Maximum key sequence length in the batch.
        dropout_p: float. Dropout probability.
        softmax_scale: float. The scaling of QK^T before applying softmax.
            Default to 1 / sqrt(headdim).
        causal: bool. Whether to apply causal attention mask (e.g., for auto-regressive modeling).
        window_size: (left, right). If not (-1, -1), implements sliding window local attention.
        softcap: float. Anything > 0 activates softcapping attention.
        alibi_slopes: (nheads,) or (batch_size, nheads), fp32. A bias of
            (-alibi_slope * |i + seqlen_k - seqlen_q - j|)
            is added to the attention score of query i and key j.
        return_attn_probs: bool. Whether to return the attention probabilities. This option is for
           testing only. The returned probabilities are not guaranteed to be correct
           (they might not have the right scaling).
    Return:
        out: (total, nheads, headdim).
        softmax_lse [optional, if return_attn_probs=True]: (nheads, total_q_seqlen). The
            logsumexp of each row of the matrix QK^T * scaling (e.g., log of the softmax
            normalization factor).
